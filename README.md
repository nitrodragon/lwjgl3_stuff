# The Lovely Process of Me Learning LWJGL 3

I'm back for another round of LWJGL, and this time, it's current. Final project should resemble a 2D RPG game, complete with collision, GUIs and such. 

## Thundering Sky
Of course, 85% of the reason I'm learning this is because of *Thundering Sky*, so expect progress with that as I grow more fluent.
